RNN Implementation using NumPy

- Sequence input, Char-level, Batch training, Python 3

- You could train RNNs using different vector representations. (Try "glove" or "word2vec" to train the sequence of words instead of the "One-hot-vector")

- This is a slightly modified version of the original code(Karpathy).
